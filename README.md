You can use Apache Cordova with your own mobile app and have the same capabilities of a native app. For more information about using the plug-in on top of your iOS and Android platforms, see the Cordova documentation in [IBM Knowledge Center](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSMRK7_3.0.0/AppPush/cordova_container.dita).

You can also view the SDK documentation through IBM Marketing Cloud. IBM Marketing Cloud requires a separate username and password. If you need a username and password, contact your Client Services representative.
